I was part of the team that helped select the top three players to represent our college at the University level. One of the players, Ayush, a first-year student, achieved a significant milestone by reaching the North Zone finals. It was a joyful moment for me to see him succeed, as it reminded me of the exposure I didnâ€™t have during my early years. Seeing him progress filled me with happiness, knowing my efforts contributed to giving juniors the opportunity to shine.`,
